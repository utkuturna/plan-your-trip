# Plan your trip: Tiqets Frontend Assignment

Thanks for applying! This assignment allows us to assess your Frontend skills, specifically the technical expertise and knowledge we look for in a fellow Frontend Developer.

## The app to be built

You will build a product searcher, where users will select a Country, City and Date, and then a list of products will be shown based on those search options.

The app is responsive to the screen width. For simplicity's sake, we'll focus on 2 sizes and refer to them as _mobile_ and _desktop_.

### Design specification

[Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/file/6qsa896sJurITBaw6sw1ml/Front-end-assignment?node-id=0%3A1). With this document, you should be able to understand the user flow and all UI states, as well as the CSS styles that should be applied overall.

### How it should work

There are essentially 3 main sections in the app:

### 1) Country and City filters.

- On mobile, the filters should be on top of each other. On desktop, they should be next to each other.
- Initially, neither filter will have a selected value. The City filter should be disabled, and only become enabled after a Country is selected.
- The Country filter will list all possible Countries, after selecting a Country, the City filter will list only the Cities corresponding to the selected Country.
- The data for the Countries and Cities is provided by a JSON API. [See details](#apis) below.

### 2) Date Picker

- On mobile, at least the first 4 Dates should be shown. As the viewport gets wider, then up to 7 Dates should be shown.
  - Note: the design shows 5 Dates on Mobile, as there is enough available space on devices with a 375px wide viewport, but please also consider smaller viewports.
- Initially, all Dates will be disabled. Only after selecting a City the Dates will become enabled.
- The data for the avaiable Dates is provided by a JSON API. [See API details](#apis) below.

### 3) Search Results / List of Products / Product Card

- After selecting a Date, the app should make a request to the product search JSON API (provided, [see API details](#apis) below). The response will be a list of products, which data will be used to render the list of results.
- Each product is visually represented by a Product Card. The card has a different layout between mobile and desktop.
- Each card shows: title, short description, image, and price.
- Some products include a _discount percentage_. In this case, a _pre-discount price_ should be shown in the card. This _pre-discount_ is **calculated** based on the _price_ and the _discount percentage_.
- The product image on the card has a different aspect ratio between mobile and desktop. The images should be lazy-loaded.
- Clicking the card should navigate users to the Tiqets.com page for that product.
- On mobile, the cards should be shown in a single column - in other words, on top of each other. On desktop, they should be shown in 2 columns, as shown in the [Design specification](#design-specification).
- For the layout of this list of products, **CSS Grid** should be used.
- If no products were found, show a message: "Nothing found, please try a different date".

## APIs

We provide all the JSON API endpoints.

### City and Country

```
localhost:3001/locations
```

This endpoint returns the fixed list of countries as well as the list of cities and the cities' IDs, all in a single response.

```
{
  "The Netherlands": [
    [111, "Amsterdam"],
    [222, "Rotterdam"],
    [333, "Utrecht"],
    [444, "Delft"],
    ...
  ],
  "United States": [
    [111, "New York City"],
    [222, "Seattle"],
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Dates

```
http://localhost:3001/available_dates
```

This endpoint returns the fixed list of Dates that should be shown, all in a single response.

```
{
  "dates": ["2021-07-30", "2021-07-31", ... , "2021-08-07"]
}
```

### Product Search

```
http://localhost:3001/products?date=2021-07-31&city_id=66154
```

This endpoint returns a dynamic list of products, based on the URL parameters passed.

- `city_id` - the ID of a city. Number. Required. Example: `city_id=321`.
- `date` - date, formatted in ISO. String. Required. Example: `date=2021-12-25`.

```

## General guidelines

Here's a few things that we generally expect in the delivery:

- A full implementation of the visual design and the functionality presented above.
- As few external or 3rd-party libraries as possible.
- Use of semantic, accessible markup.
- All scripting must be written in TypeScript.
- For styling, you're welcome to use any tool you prefer.

## General information

- The app was bootstrapped with Create React App.
- In this repo we're using npm, and not yarn.
- It should work in Node v12 or above.

## Development

In order to get started working:

1. Install all necessary dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run start` to start the API server and the react app in development mode. That's it!

## Delivery

Once you have finished the assignment, please answer the questions in `COMMENTS.md`. We're curious to your findings!

To send your code to us, you can either:

1. Zip the whole directory and send us the file (please do not include the `node_modules` main directory!) or
2. Publish your code into a GitHub repository and send us the link.
   If you prefer to keep it private, you can add the **`tiqets-fe`** user as a project collaborator,
   so we can access it.
3. We should be able to run `npm install && npm run build` and get the app bundled for production use.
